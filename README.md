# lcNrD

lowercase AND remove Duplicates - A Very Simple Program;

I find myself having to clean up data quite often & lose python scripts that I write for data cleaning. So I've decided to start this lcNrD project that is a but more of a permanent solution & I will add to its usefulness as I see fit.

## Current Functionality:
* Lowercase the text of a file
* Remove duplicates of a file
* Copy all operations onto a new file

## Program Arguments: (* = required)

```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
* -f FILE, --file FILE  this is the file you're targeting to get the lcNrD
                        treatment
  -o OUT, --out OUT     this is the file you want the lcNrD file to output as
  -l, --lowercase       add -l to set lowercase to true
  -d, --duplicates      add -d to remove duplicate elements
```
