# lcNrD

lowercase AND remove Duplicates - A Very Simple Program;

I find myself having to clean up data quite often & lose python scripts that I write for data cleaning. So I've decided to start this lcNrD project that is a but more of a permanent solution & I will add to its usefulness as I see fit.

## Current Functionality:
* Lowercase the text of a file
* Remove duplicates of a file
* Copy all operations onto a new file

## optional arguments: (* = required)

```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
* --target TARGET       this is the file you're targeting to get the lcNrD
                        treatment (default: None)
  --outputName OUTPUTNAME
                        this is the file you want the lcNrD file to output as
                        (default: None)
  --lowercase LOWERCASE
                        T = lowercase all, F = keep original (default: T)
  --removeDups REMOVEDUPS
                        T = lowercase all, F = keep original (default: T)
```
